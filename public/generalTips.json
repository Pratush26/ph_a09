      "Check soil moisture before watering — stick a finger 2–3 cm into the soil.",
      "Less frequent, deep watering is usually better than frequent shallow watering.",

    ],
    "sunlightPrinciples": [
      "Bright indirect light is best for most houseplants.",

    "fertilizerPrinciples": [
      "Feed actively-growing plants during spring and summer, reduce in fall/winter.",
